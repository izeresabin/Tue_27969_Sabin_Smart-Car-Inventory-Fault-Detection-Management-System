## 📌 Phase I: Problem Identification & Project Overview

### Overview
This phase focuses on identifying a real-world problem that can be effectively solved using an Oracle Database and PL/SQL–based system. The goal is to clearly define the problem context, target users, and the value of the proposed solution.

### Problem Statement
Car dealerships manage large inventories of vehicles, each undergoing multiple inspections, repairs, and evaluations before being sold. Managing these processes without an automated system leads to data inconsistency, delayed fault detection, and inefficient decision-making.

The proposed system introduces a centralized database solution that automates car inventory management, inspection tracking, and fault detection using PL/SQL.

### Target Users
- Dealership staff responsible for vehicle registration and inspections  
- Mechanics handling repairs and fault resolution  
- Managers overseeing operations and performance  
- Auditors responsible for compliance and accountability  

### Key Outcomes
- Clearly defined system scope and objectives  
- Identification of operational challenges to be addressed  
- Foundation for database design and process modeling in subsequent phases
