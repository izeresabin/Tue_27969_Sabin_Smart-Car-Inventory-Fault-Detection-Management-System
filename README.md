# 🚗 Smart Car Inventory and Fault Management System

# project overview
## 📘 Introduction

Car dealerships manage large inventories of vehicles, each of which undergoes multiple inspections, repairs, and evaluations before being approved for sale. Managing these processes manually or without a centralized system can lead to data inconsistencies, delayed fault detection, and inefficient decision-making.

This project presents a **Smart Car Inventory & Fault-Detection Management System** developed using **Oracle Database and PL/SQL** to automate the management of vehicles, inspections, faults, and mechanic activities. The system intelligently identifies and flags vehicles with repeated faults, ensuring improved operational efficiency, enhanced data integrity, and faster, more informed decision-making within a real-world dealership environment.
## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Design and implement a robust Oracle database schema for managing car inventory, inspections, and fault records  
- Automate core dealership operations using PL/SQL procedures, functions, and packages  
- Enforce business rules and data integrity through database triggers and constraints  
- Automatically detect and flag vehicles with repeated or critical faults  
- Maintain comprehensive audit logs for accountability and traceability of system operations  
- Provide analytical insights to support informed and data-driven decision-making  
## 🚀 What Our Solution Delivers

- Centralized management of car inventory, inspections, and fault records  
- Automated detection and flagging of vehicles with repeated or critical faults  
- Enforcement of business rules directly at the database level using PL/SQL triggers  
- Secure and controlled data operations through procedures and packaged logic  
- Comprehensive audit trails to track user actions and system events  
- Reliable, consistent, and scalable data storage aligned with real-world dealership operations
## 🌍 Real-World Impact

- Customers benefit from improved vehicle reliability through early fault detection  
- Dealership staff gain real-time visibility into vehicle status and fault history  
- Mechanics can efficiently track inspections, repairs, and recurring issues  
- Managers access accurate operational and analytical reports for decision-making  
- Auditors can trace all system activities through comprehensive audit logs
